## Data description

Each data item contains a particle image pair (input for CNN) and the corresponding ground-truth motion field (output). For example:

	\PIV-genImages\data\uniform\uniform_00001_img1.tif
	\PIV-genImages\data\uniform\uniform_00001_img2.tif
	\PIV-genImages\data\uniform\uniform_00001_flow.flo

A train-validation split is also provided:

	FlowData_train.list
	FlowData_test.list


## Generating particle images

The intensity for each particle of the synthetic images is satisfied to a Gaussian function:

where $I_{0}$ is the peak intensity in the Gaussian center, $d_p$ denotes the particle diameter and $(x_0,y_0)$ the position of the particle. Let $\rho$ be the particle seeding density of the image. Each parameter is randomly selected in a proper range:


|Parameter       |Range                       | Unit                        |
|----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Seeding density $\rho$  |  0.05 - 0.1         |particle per pixel           |
| Particle diameter $d_p$ | 1-4               |pixel                        |
|Peak intensity   $I_{0}$| 200-255            |grey value                   |
|Location $(x_0,y_0)$| 1-256                  |pixel                        |


All the images are in a resolution of 256 * 256 pixel. 
**Here are some images with different parametersï¼š**
**a)** seeding density $\rho$ = 0.078 ppp, particle diameter $d_p$ = 1.31 pixel, **b)** $\rho$ = 0.051 ppp, $d_p$ = 3.68 pixel, **c)** $\rho$ = 0.069 ppp, $d_p$ = 2.81 pixel.

## Flow motions

The dataset includes a variety of flow motions to increase the data diversity. Some simple cases are simulated by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Also, there are some flow fields available online, such as [2D DNS turbulent flow](http://fluid.irisa.fr/data-eng.htm), sea flow driven by [surface quasi-geographic model](http://vressegu.github.io/sqgmu/) and various flow patterns provides by [Johns Hopkins Turbulence Databases](http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/).

The descriptions of the motion fields for PIV neural network training are presented below:
